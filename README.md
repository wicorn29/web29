**Web29 is now officially discontinued.**

Thank you to everyone who used and supported the service.

Due to storage limitations on my server, I had to make the difficult decision to permanently shut down Web29. In order to free up critical space, all hosted websites and user data were purged and are no longer recoverable.

I understand this may be disappointing, and I truly appreciate everyone who explored, built, and contributed to the platform.

To support transparency and allow others to learn from or build upon the project, I will be releasing the Web29 server backend as a public archive. This will include the core platform code and documentation, so anyone interested can review, reuse, or repurpose the system for their own needs.

Once again, thank you for being a part of Web29.
